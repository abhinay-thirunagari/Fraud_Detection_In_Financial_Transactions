# Improving Fraud Detection Accuracy in Financial Transactions using a Hybrid Model of Machine Learning Techniques

This project presents a hybrid model that combines three machine learning approaches (XGBoost Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier) to increase the accuracy of fraud detection in financial transactions. The research was conducted by Shivani Reddy Pullagurla, Anusha Vunnamand, and Abhinay Thirunagari, students at Kennesaw State University in Georgia, USA.

## Abstract:

The banking sector faces the challenge of identifying fraudulent activity in financial transactions. The accuracy of fraud detection systems is critical in tracking down and avoiding fraudulent transactions. This research proposes a hybrid model that integrates three machine learning approaches to increase the accuracy of fraud detection in financial transactions. The proposed hybrid model outperformed individual models and achieved an accuracy of 99.23%, demonstrating its potential for use by financial institutions to improve existing fraud detection systems.
